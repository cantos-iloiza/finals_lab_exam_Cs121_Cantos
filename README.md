The Dice Game System is an object-oriented Python application that simulates a dice rolling game versus a CPU opponent. It offers a simple interface for players to register, log in, play the game, see top scores, and log out. The system was designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, using classes and functions to manage user accounts, gaming sessions, and score keeping.
